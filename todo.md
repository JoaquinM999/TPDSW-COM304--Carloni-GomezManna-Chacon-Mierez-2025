🔴 PASO 1 Missing Frontend Services (4 services needed):
❌ autorService.ts - For author-related API calls
❌ editorialService.ts - For publisher-related API calls
❌ sagaService.ts - For saga-related API calls
❌ reaccionService.ts - For reaction-related API calls
🔴PASO 2 Missing Backend Controllers & Routes (2 entities):
✅ Actividad entity exists with controller and routes - Activity tracking system is fully implemented and working
❌ Permiso entity exists but no controller or routes - For role-based permissions system
❌ RatingLibro entity exists but no controller or routes - For storing book ratings and review counts
✅ PASO 3 Activity Tracking System Implemented:
The Actividad entity now logs user actions automatically when users create reviews, add favorites, follow others, add reactions, and create lists. The system includes:
- ActividadService for centralized activity creation
- Activity tracking in all relevant controllers (resena, favorito, seguimiento, reaccion, lista)
- Fault-tolerant design that logs errors but doesn't break main functionality
🔴 PASO 4 Possibly Incomplete Frontend Pages:
Some pages appear to use mock data instead of real API calls:

AutoresPage.tsx - Uses mock author data
SagasPage.tsx - Uses mock saga data
Some pages may not be fully connected to the backend APIs
🔴 PASO 5 Missing Admin Pages:
No admin pages for managing Actividad, Permiso, or RatingLibro entities
No admin interface for user permissions management
✅ What's Already Complete:
All minimum requirements (CRUD operations, relationships, lists, reviews)
Moderation system with bad word filtering
Reaction system (likes/dislikes/hearts)
Following system
Recommendation system
Most frontend pages exist
Summary: The core functionality is solid, but you need 4 frontend services, 3 backend controllers/routes, and an activity tracking system to have a complete implementation according to the README specifications.
